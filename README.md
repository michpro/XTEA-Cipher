# XTEA-Cipher library for Arduino

XTEA cipher library with MAC code calculation support for Arduino environment. Supported encryption modes are: ECB, CFB and OCB and for generating message authentication codes is CFB-MAC. 'C' code of this library was optimized for lowest possible use of program memory. Contrary to reference implementation, base data type is uint8_t[] instead of uint_32_t.

## Constants

Configure library settings in file `xtea.h`, or better in your sketch, by adding directive `#define XTEA_ROUNDS n ` or/and `#define XTEA_MAC_ROUNDS n ` before directive including this cipher library e.g.:
```c
...
#define XTEA_ROUNDS 48
#define XTEA_MAC_ROUNDS 24

#include "XTEA-Cipher.h"
...
```

- **XTEA_ROUNDS**

  actual number of Feistel rounds during cipher is `2 * XTEA_ROUNDS`

  [default value is `32`]

- **XTEA_MAC_ROUNDS**
  
  actual number of Feistel rounds during MAC calculation is `2 * XTEA_MAC_ROUNDS`

  [default value is `32`]
  
  ---
  known attack is on 36 Feistel rounds (18 `XTEA_ROUNDS` or `XTEA_MAC_ROUNDS`)

- **XTEA_BLOCK_SIZE**
  
  data block size = 64-bit [8 bytes]

  [*Do NOT change its value*]

- **XTEA_IV_SIZE**
  
  size of initialization vector [IV] (a.k.a. NONCE) = 64-bit [8 bytes]

  [*Do NOT change its value*]

- **XTEA_KEY_SIZE**
  
  key size = 128-bit [16 bytes]

  [*Do NOT change its value*]
